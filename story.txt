Once there was a guy named Bill that was floating in the ocean. He could not remember how he got there. He looked to his left and found out that there was a shark in the water.
When he saw the shark, he decided to swim as fast as he could away from the animal. But the shark was much faster. He tried his best to swim fast, but could not 
out swim the shark. Just as quick as the shark had appeared, it went away. Bill looked to his right and saw an island. He then swam over to it.

Bill was eager to be on land once again, unsure of how long he had been in the water.
He was even more excited to be away from the shark!  Unfortunately, his relief didn't 
last long.  Almost as soon as he stopped holding his breath did he turn left to see 
the only thing worse than a shark without legs - a shark with legs, running right 
towards him.  

Bill was scared and tried to run away from the shark with legs. However, the shark seemed to be
not accusomted to using its legs to hunt its prey. Bill kept a distance away from the shark and
tried to find a weapon that could kill the shark. He found a sharp-ended stick on his right. He
held it against the shark and was prepared to kill. As the shark approached him closer, Bill stabbed
the shark and killed it. Bill started to study how this shark developed legs that allowed it to 
maneuver inland. However, he did not know what was slowly, secretly approaching him from behind.

It was a land-orca! That is, an orca with legs. Fortunately, orcas are
friendly and have never been known to attack people in the wild, so Bill
didn't die horribly, possibly screaming. The orca helped him repel land-sharks
from his island abode, and from that day on, Bill lived in peace.
