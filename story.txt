Once there was a guy named Bill that was floating in the ocean. He could not remember how he got there. He looked to his left and found out that there was a shark in the water.
When he saw the shark, he decided to swim as fast as he could away from the animal. But the shark was much faster. He tried his best to swim fast, but could not 
out swim the shark. Just as quick as the shark had appeared, it went away. Bill looked to his right and saw an island. He then swam over to it.

Bill was eager to be on land once again, unsure of how long he had been in the water.
He was even more excited to be away from the shark!  Unfortunately, his relief didn't 
last long.  Almost as soon as he stopped holding his breath did he turn left to see 
the only thing worse than a shark without legs - a shark with legs, running right 
towards him.
